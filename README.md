The purpose of this program is to calculate the value of resistor, capacitor, inductor components, making it easier for users to find out the value of a resistor and capacitor components by inputting the information shown on the resistors, capacitors and inductors into the program, then the program will process the input data and display the component value and its tolerance range at display.

Using:
- Modular Programming
- Struct programming
- Array
- System calling
