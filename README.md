FINAL PROJECT DASAR KOMPUTER 
By: Iqbaal Fadlli Besstian and Andri Rahardian

The purpose of this program is to calculate the value of resistor and capacitor components, making it easier for users to find out the value of a resistor and capacitor components by inputting the information shown on the resistors and capacitors into the program, then the program will process the input data and display the component value and its tolerance range at display.
